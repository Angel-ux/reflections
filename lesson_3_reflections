When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you are on another computer or there are several people working on it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because there are more control on the files and could be some changes which at the
    end you really do not want to commit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks:Creates a repository copy from GitHub to GitHub (The changes are not updated
        on the source repository unless you have permissions).
    Clone:Creates a repository copy from GitHub to Local (Includes commits).
    Branch:Creates a kind of version on the specified repository to allow make several
        changes without affect the "master" branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    To know when you pulled the information and to be possible diferentiate from
    other changes that possible was made on GitHub directly.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Using versions of every one and merging if accept.
    Would be easier to get a version control and will be harder to remember all commands 
    and what they do.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
