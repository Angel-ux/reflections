How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Checking only the differences and not all the code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Making several manual copies.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The cons are the human error, forget to make it or needed a program
    The pros is to have only the needed files.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It is useful since there is changes not necessary on all files, to make the match is better.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log --stat to get the differences on the files also and git diff
    to check for te real changes on the file.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because you have a lot of executable versions.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Nothing
